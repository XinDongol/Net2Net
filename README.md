# Net2Net

This is some extensional experiences based on ['Net2Net: Accelerating Learning via Knowledge Transfer'](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05641), which proposed that how o ttransfer the information stored in one neural net into another neural net with the concept of function- preserving transformations between neural network specification.

We want to copy the nodes of the network with certain regulation while the origin paper did it randomly. Our ultimate purpose is to enable network to do self replication according to its requirement of representation.
